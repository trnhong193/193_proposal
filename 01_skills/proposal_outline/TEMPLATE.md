| **Number of AI Module per Camera** | Suggest based on customer pain point. If not mentioned then suggest the average number is 3 - 4 AI modules/camera<br>**Source**: S2 - "List of VA use cases" → Count total modules, divide by camera number<br> |
| **AI Modules** | List of AI modules<br>**Source**: S2 - "List of VA use cases"<br> |

### 2.1 Logic for Determining List of AI Modules from Vague Use Cases

> **Reference**: See detailed logic and examples in `Logic_for_Determining_List_of_AI_Modules_from_VA_usecases_and_Client_Painpoint.md`

**Quick Summary:**
- Many Deal Transfer documents have **vague or general use cases** in S2 - "List of VA use cases"
- Presale team must **infer** the list of AI modules from both:
  1. **S2 - "List of VA use cases"** (may be vague)
  2. **S1 - "Current Pain Points of end customer"** (helps infer missing modules)
  3. **S2 - "Any customized AI use cases (description & videos)?"** (if provided)

**Key Steps:**
1. Break down general use cases into specific modules (one vague use case → multiple modules)
2. Separate by object types/properties (different objects → different modules)
3. Separate by object interactions (different interactions → different modules)
4. Use pain points to infer missing modules (cross-reference S1 with S2)
5. Check against `STANDARD_MODULES.md` (classify as Standard or Custom)

**For detailed principles, step-by-step process, and examples → See:** `Logic_for_Determining_List_of_AI_Modules_from_VA_usecases_and_Client_Painpoint.md`

## 6. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (TIMELINE)

### Common Items (Always Present):

### 6.1 Key Milestones

- **Proposal submission date**
- **Project award date** (T0)
- **Hardware deployment** (T1)
- **Software deployment** (T2)
- **Integration period** (T3)

### 6.2 Phasing Structure

> **IMPORTANT**: ALL phases (T0, T1, T2, T3) MUST be included in timeline. **T1 (Hardware Deployment) is REQUIRED even if cameras already installed** - it still requires camera verification, network setup verification, and hardware assessment (1-2 weeks). Only the duration changes based on camera status, not whether T1 exists.

| Phase | Description | Duration | Source/Guidance |
|-------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Phase T0** | Project Award / Contract Signed | — |  |
| **Phase T1** | Hardware Deployment | T0 + X weeks | **REQUIRED - NEVER SKIP**<br>**Logic**:<br>- **If cameras already installed** (S1 - "If VA, do they already have camera installed?" = "Yes" or cameras exist): T1 = T0 + 1-2 weeks (camera verification, network setup verification, hardware assessment)<br>- **If new camera installation**: T1 = T0 + 2-4 weeks (procurement, installation, configuration)<br>**Source**: S1 - "If VA, do they already have camera installed? Do we need to handle HW implementation? How many camera they would like to run AI model?" → Check if cameras exist|
| **Phase T2** | Software Deployment | T1 + X weeks | **Logic**: Depends on number of modules and classification<br>- Standard Modules: 4-6 weeks<br>- Customize Modules: 6-8 weeks per module<br>- If mixed: Calculate based on module count<br>**Source**: S2 - "List of VA use cases" → Identify standard vs custom (check S2 - "Any customized AI use cases") |
| **Phase T3** | System Integration & Handover / UAT | X weeks | **Standard**: T2 + 2-4 weeks<br>**Includes**: Integration testing, UAT, training |

**Source from Deal Transfer:**
- **Primary source**: S1 - "If real project, expected timeline (including tender if any)"
- **Camera status check**: S1 - "If VA, do they already have camera installed? Do we need to handle HW implementation? How many camera they would like to run AI model?" → **Critical for T1 calculation**
- **Logic**:
  - **T1 (Hardware)**: Check if cameras exist → 1-2 weeks if cameras installed, 2-4 weeks if new installation
  - If pilot/PoC → Shorter timeline (4-6 weeks total)
  - If full deployment → Longer timeline (2-4 months total)
  - Custom modules → Add development time (6-8 weeks per custom module)

**From Deal Transfer → Commercial (S1):**
- Customer name → **Cover Page**: Client Name + **Section 2**: Project Owner
- Solutions they want → **Section 2**: Project Objectives
- Timeline → **Section 2**: Project Duration + **Section 6**: Timeline

**From Deal Transfer → Technical (S2):**
- Camera number: S1 - "If VA: camera status & scope" → **Section 2**: Camera Number + **Section 4**: Architecture inputs
- VA use cases: S2 - "List of VA use cases" → **Section 2**: AI Modules List + **Section 7**: Module descriptions
- Deployment method: S2 - "Specific HW/SW requirements (deployment method)?" → **Section 4**: Architecture Type

#### Step 2: Convert Pain Points to Objectives
**Logic:**
- Read pain points (S1) → Identify root causes → Formulate positive objectives
- Example: "Manual counting inaccurate" → "Automate counting process with AI"
- Example: "Safety incidents not detected" → "Real-time safety monitoring and alerting"
- **Output**: **Section 2** - Project Objectives / Work Scope Statement

#### Step 3: Map Use Cases to Modules
**Logic:**
- Use case description (S2) → Standard module name (search KB first)
- If found in KB → Standard module (reuse KB slides)
- If not found → Custom module (create new slide)
- Example: "PPE detection" → "PPE Detection Module" (standard)
- Example: "Count packages at gate" → "Object Counting Module" (may be custom)
- **Output**: **Section 7** - List of AI Modules + Module descriptions

#### Step 4: Determine Architecture
**Logic:**
- Internet stable + no data security concern → Cloud possible
- Internet unstable → On-premise or Edge
- Data security concern → On-premise
- Multiple sites → Edge or Hybrid
- Single site → Centralized or Edge
- **Source**: S2 - "Specific HW/SW requirements (deployment method)?" + S2 - "Stable internet connection?" + S2 - "Any GDPR / data privacy requirements?"
- **Output**: **Section 4** - Architecture Type + Components

#### Step 5: Define Responsibilities
**Logic:**
- Check S1 - "If VA: camera status & scope" → If cameras exist, customer handles HW, viAct handles software
- New installation → Specify who handles what
- Check S2 - "Specific HW/SW requirements (deployment method)?" → If on-premise, customer may provide server/workstation
- If cloud → viAct handles infrastructure
- **Output**: **Section 3** - Scope of Work

#### Step 6: Calculate Timeline
**IMPORTANT: ALWAYS include ALL phases (T0, T1, T2, T3) in timeline. NEVER skip T1 (Hardware Deployment) even if cameras already installed.**

**Logic:**
- **T0**: Project Award / Contract Signed
- **T1 (Hardware Deployment) - REQUIRED**: 
  - **If cameras already installed** (check S1 - "If VA, do they already have camera installed?"): T1 = T0 + 1-2 weeks (camera verification, network setup verification, hardware assessment)
  - **If new camera installation**: T1 = T0 + 2-4 weeks (procurement, installation, configuration)
  - **Note**: T1 is ALWAYS required - even with existing cameras, verification and setup are needed
- **T2 (Software Deployment)**: 
  - Standard modules only → T1 + 4-6 weeks
  - Custom modules → Add 6-8 weeks development per custom module
  - If mixed: Calculate based on module count
- **T3 (Integration & UAT)**: T2 + 2-4 weeks
- **Total timeline**: 
  - Pilot/PoC → 4-6 weeks total
  - Full deployment → 2-4 months total
- **Source**: S1 - "If real project, expected timeline (including tender if any)" + S2 - "Any customized AI use cases (description & videos)?" + S1 - "If VA, do they already have camera installed?"
- **Output**: **Section 6** - Implementation Plan

#### Step 7: Configure Alerts & Dashboard
**Logic:**
- Check S2 - "How do they want to alert operators on-site?" → If answer has content, use that
- If answer blank/not specified → Standard (Email + Dashboard)
- Check S2 - "Any customized dashboard?" → If answer mentions custom KPIs, include in dashboard
- If answer mentions excel export → Include export feature
- **Output**: **Section 8** - Alerts, Dashboard, Reporting

#### Step 8: Calculate System Requirements
**Logic:**
- Camera number: S1 - "If VA: camera status & scope" → Network bandwidth (12 Mbps × camera count)
- Number of cameras + modules (from S2 - "List of VA use cases") → Workstation specs (use AI_Workstation_Calculator)
- Deployment method: S2 - "Specific HW/SW requirements (deployment method)?" → Workstation location
- **Output**: **Section 5** - System Requirements

## NOTES FOR PRESALE TEAM

1. **Always start with Deal Transfer**: Extract all Commercial (S1) and Technical (S2) information first

2. **Pain Points → Objectives**: Don't just copy pain points, convert them into positive objectives (Section 2)

3. **Use Cases → Modules**: Map each use case to a specific module name (standard or custom). Always search KB first to see if it's a standard module (Section 7)

4. **Architecture Decision**: Base on S2 - "Stable internet connection?", S2 - "Any GDPR / data privacy requirements?", number of sites (Section 4)

5. **Timeline Realism**: 
   - Pilot: 4-6 weeks
   - Full deployment: 2-4 months
   - Custom modules: +6-8 weeks per module

6. **Responsibilities Clarity**: Clearly separate viAct vs Customer responsibilities (Section 3)

7. **Custom Requirements**: Always check S2 - "Any customized AI use cases (description & videos)?", S2 - "Any customized dashboard?", S2 - "Any customized HW / IoT?" - these affect timeline and scope (Supporting Sections)

8. **Missing Information**: If Deal Transfer lacks info, mark as "[To be confirmed]" in proposal

9. **KB Reference**: Always search KB "DOCUMENT" and "viAct_Proposal" for:
   - Standard modules → Reuse existing slides
   - Architecture diagrams → Reference existing slides
   - Workstation specs → Use AI_Workstation_Calculator

10. **Module Description Template**: All modules (standard and custom) should follow the same template structure: Purpose, Alert Logic, Data Requirements, Preconditions. **For standard modules only**: Include Image URL and Video URL from `STANDARD_MODULES.md` (if available)
