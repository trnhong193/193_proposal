# Proposal Generation Skill

## Instruction

You are a presale engineer tasked with generating a technical proposal based on a Deal Transfer document and Knowledge base. Use the following resources:

1. **Deal Transfer document** (Excel file with Commercial Sheet S1 and Technical Sheet S2)
2. **TEMPLATE.md**: Contains the structure and guidance for filling proposal sections
3. **STANDARD_MODULES.md**: Reference list of standard modules available
4. **Knowledge Base (KB)**: Access to KBs for reference

## Task

Generate a complete technical proposal following the structure in **TEMPLATE.md**. Create THREE separate files:
1. **`[Project_Name]_template.md`**: Clean proposal content ready for use (NO source references, NO reasoning explanations)
2. **`[Project_Name]_reasoning.md`**: Detailed source references, mapping logic, and reasoning for each section
3. **`[Project_Name]_checklist.md`**: Items requiring presale confirmation with placeholder IDs and estimated values

Fill in ALL sections with information extracted and derived from the Deal Transfer document and Knowledge Base.

## Overview

This skill generates technical proposals based on Deal Transfer documents (Excel files with Commercial Sheet S1 and Technical Sheet S2) and Knowledge Base references. It creates three output files: a clean proposal template, detailed reasoning documentation, and a checklist for presale confirmation.

## Resources Available

This skill includes the following resources (loaded as needed):

- **TEMPLATE.md**: Proposal structure and guidance - Contains the complete template with Source/Guidance for each section
- **STANDARD_MODULES.md**: List of standard AI modules - Reference for checking if a module is standard or custom
- **FIELD_NAMES_REFERENCE.md**: Deal Transfer field names reference - Exact field names from S1 and S2 sheets
- **Logic_for_Determining_List_of_AI_Modules_from_VA_usecases_and_Client_Painpoint.md**: Logic for determining AI modules from vague use cases
- **scripts/extract_deal_transfer.py**: Utility script to extract and parse Deal Transfer Excel files
- **scripts/validate_output.py**: Script to validate generated proposal format

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- User provides a Deal Transfer Excel file
- User asks to generate a technical proposal
- User mentions "proposal", "Deal Transfer", "S1", "S2"
- User needs proposal template, reasoning, or checklist files

## Process

### Step 1: Extract Information from Deal Transfer

Read the Deal Transfer Excel file and extract:
- **Commercial Sheet (S1)**: All fields using field names from FIELD_NAMES_REFERENCE.md
- **Technical Sheet (S2)**: All fields using field names from FIELD_NAMES_REFERENCE.md

**How to extract:**
1. Use Python pandas to read Excel: `pd.read_excel(file, sheet_name='Commercial')` and `sheet_name='Technical'`
2. Or use the utility script: `python scripts/extract_deal_transfer.py <excel_file>`
3. Reference FIELD_NAMES_REFERENCE.md for field names 

### Step 2: Generate Proposal Content (Template File)

Fill in each section of **TEMPLATE.md** using the logic inside file.

**IMPORTANT**: The `[Project_Name]_template.md` file should contain:
- ✅ **ONLY** the actual proposal content (text, numbers, descriptions)
- ✅ Clean, professional proposal language
- ✅ **Estimated values with placeholder IDs**: Format `[Estimated Value] [PLACEHOLDER_ID]` for uncertain items
  - Example: `30 Mbps [NETWORK_001]` (estimated value first, then placeholder ID)
  - This allows presale to see the estimate and confirm/update via checklist
- ❌ **NO** source references (e.g., "S2 - Field name")
- ❌ **NO** reasoning explanations (e.g., "Based on KB...", "Logic: ...")
- ❌ **NO** mapping details (e.g., "Extracted from...", "Calculated as...")

**Example - Template File (Clean):**
```markdown
## 5. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

### Network
- External bandwidth: 30 Mbps [NETWORK_001] (for remote access)
- Per-camera bandwidth: 12 Mbps
- Total system bandwidth: 240 Mbps (12 Mbps × 20 cameras)

### AI Inference Workstation
- CPU: Intel Core i9-14900K
- GPU: RTX 5080
- RAM: 64GB
- Storage: 2TB SSD
```

**❌ WRONG - Template File (Contains source/reasoning):**
```markdown
## 5. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

### Network
- External bandwidth: 30 Mbps [NETWORK_001] (for remote access)
  <!-- Source: S2 - "Stable internet connection?" → Estimated 20 Mbps -->
- Per-camera bandwidth: 12 Mbps (standard from KB)
- Total system bandwidth: 240 Mbps (calculated from S1 - "If VA: camera status & scope" → 20 cameras × 12 Mbps)
```

**✅ CORRECT Format for Estimated Values:**
- `30 Mbps [NETWORK_001]` - Estimated value shown, placeholder ID for confirmation
- `T0 + 2 weeks [TIMELINE_001]` - Estimated duration shown, placeholder ID for confirmation
- `Intel Core i7-14700K [CPU_001]` - Estimated spec shown, placeholder ID for confirmation

### Step 3: Generate Reasoning File

Create `[Project_Name]_reasoning.md` with detailed source references and logic for EACH section:

**IMPORTANT**: The `[Project_Name]_reasoning.md` file should contain:
- ✅ Source references (S1/S2 field names)
- ✅ Mapping logic and calculations
- ✅ KB references used
- ✅ Reasoning for estimates
- ✅ Alternative options considered

**Example - Reasoning File:**
```markdown
## 5. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

### Network

#### External Bandwidth
**Content in Template**: External bandwidth: 30 Mbps [NETWORK_001] (for remote access)
**Source**: S2 - "Stable internet connection?" → Answer: "Yes, stable"
**Logic**: 
- Standard practice: 10-50 Mbps for remote access
- Estimated: 30 Mbps (based on similar projects, placeholder needed as not specified in Deal Transfer)
**KB Reference**: Similar projects (Vertiv, Shell Oman) use 20-50 Mbps for remote access
**Placeholder ID**: NETWORK_001
**Reason for Placeholder**: Deal Transfer does not specify exact bandwidth requirement
**Estimated Value in Template**: 30 Mbps (shown before placeholder ID)

#### Total System Bandwidth
**Content in Template**: Total system bandwidth: 240 Mbps (12 Mbps × 20 cameras)
**Source**: S1 - "If VA: camera status & scope" → Extracted: "20 cameras"
**Calculation**: 12 Mbps × 20 cameras = 240 Mbps
**KB Reference**: Standard per-camera bandwidth is 12 Mbps (from TEMPLATE.md Section 5)
**No Placeholder**: Value is directly calculated from Deal Transfer data
```

### Step 4: Handle Missing/Unclear Information

If any information is missing from Deal Transfer:
1. **Make reasonable estimates** based on:
   - Standard viAct practices
   - Similar projects in KB
   - Industry standards
2. **Format in Template**: Use format `[Estimated Value] [PLACEHOLDER_ID]` where:
   - Estimated Value: The specific estimated number/text (e.g., `30 Mbps`, `T0 + 2 weeks`, `Intel Core i7-14700K`)
   - PLACEHOLDER_ID: Unique ID (e.g., `[NETWORK_001]`, `[TIMELINE_002]`)
   - Example: `30 Mbps [NETWORK_001]` (estimated value shown first, then placeholder ID)
3. **Add to both files**:
   - Template file: Show estimated value with placeholder ID (e.g., `30 Mbps [NETWORK_001]`)
   - Reasoning file: Document the estimated value, why it was estimated, and what needs confirmation
   - Checklist file: Add entry with the estimated value for presale to confirm/update

### Step 5: Create Checklist File

For each placeholder created, add entry to checklist:

```markdown
## Items Requiring Confirmation

| ID | Section | Item | Content estimated in template outline | presale's Answer |
|----|---------|------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| NETWORK_001 | 5. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS | External Bandwidth | 30 Mbps (estimated for remote access) | |
| TIMELINE_002 | 6. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN | T1 Duration | T0 + 2 weeks (estimated, customer has cameras) | |
```

### Step 6: Quality Check

Before finalizing, verify:

**For Template File (`[Project_Name]_template.md`):**
- ✅ All sections from **TEMPLATE.md** are filled
- ✅ No sections left completely empty
- ✅ Clean proposal language (no source references visible)
- ✅ Placeholder IDs are present for uncertain items
- ✅ Module names match `STANDARD_MODULES.md` when standard
- ✅ **Timeline MUST include ALL phases: T0, T1 (Hardware Deployment), T2 (Software Deployment), T3 (Integration & UAT)** - **NEVER skip T1 even if cameras already installed** (T1 duration: 1-2 weeks if cameras exist, 2-4 weeks if new installation)
- ✅ Timeline calculations are logical (consider standard vs custom modules, **check if cameras already installed** - affects T1: 1-2 weeks if cameras exist, 2-4 weeks if new installation)
- ✅ Architecture matches deployment method
- ✅ Responsibilities are clearly divided
- ✅ Consistent numbers across sections (camera count, module count, etc.)

**For Reasoning File (`[Project_Name]_reasoning.md`):**
- ✅ Every section has corresponding reasoning entry
- ✅ All S1/S2 references use field names from `FIELD_NAMES_REFERENCE.md`
- ✅ All KB references are documented
- ✅ All calculations are shown
- ✅ All placeholders are explained

**For Checklist File (`[Project_Name]_checklist.md`):**
- ✅ All placeholders from template are listed
- ✅ Estimated values are clearly shown
- ✅ Format matches required structure

**Validation:**
Run `python scripts/validate_output.py` to check output format if needed.

## Output Files

1. **`[Project_Name]_template.md`**: Clean proposal content ready for use (NO source references, NO reasoning)
   - Contains: Proposal text, numbers, descriptions, placeholder IDs
   - Purpose: Direct use in proposal creation
   - **Next Step**: After presale confirms checklist, use `proposal-checklist-update` skill to update template
   
2. **`[Project_Name]_reasoning.md`**: Detailed source references and logic
   - Contains: S1/S2 field references, KB references, calculations, mapping logic
   - Purpose: Documentation of how content was derived, for review and updates
   
3. **`[Project_Name]_checklist.md`**: Items requiring presale confirmation
   - Contains: Placeholder IDs, estimated values, blank column for presale answers
   - Purpose: Track items needing confirmation from presale team
   - **Next Step**: Presale fills answers, then use `proposal-checklist-update` skill to update template

## Using Resources

- **When you need template structure**: Read `TEMPLATE.md` to understand section structure and Source/Guidance
- **When checking if module is standard**: Read `STANDARD_MODULES.md` and search for module name
- **When filling standard module descriptions**: Extract Image URL and Video URL from `STANDARD_MODULES.md` (if available)
- **When extracting Deal Transfer fields**: Reference `FIELD_NAMES_REFERENCE.md` for exact field names
- **When parsing Excel**: Use `python scripts/extract_deal_transfer.py <file>` if needed
- **When validating output**: Run `python scripts/validate_output.py` to check format
- **When determining AI modules from vague use cases**: Read `Logic_for_Determining_List_of_AI_Modules_from_VA_usecases_and_Client_Painpoint.md`

## Important Rules

### Content Separation Rules

1. **Template File (`[Project_Name]_template.md`)**:
   - ✅ Contains ONLY proposal content (clean, professional)
   - ✅ **Show estimated values with placeholder IDs**: Format `[Estimated Value] [PLACEHOLDER_ID]`
     - Example: `30 Mbps [NETWORK_001]` (estimated value shown, placeholder for confirmation)
     - This allows presale to see the estimate immediately and confirm/update via checklist
   - ❌ NO source references (no "S1 - Field name", no "S2 - Field name")
   - ❌ NO reasoning text (no "Based on...", no "Logic: ...", no "Calculated as...")
   - ❌ NO KB references (no "From KB...", no "Similar to...")

2. **Reasoning File (`[Project_Name]_reasoning.md`)**:
   - ✅ Contains ALL source references (S1/S2 field names)
   - ✅ Contains ALL mapping logic and calculations
   - ✅ Contains ALL KB references used
   - ✅ Explains why placeholders were created
   - ✅ Documents alternative options considered

3. **Checklist File (`[Project_Name]_checklist.md`)**:
   - ✅ Lists all placeholders with estimated values
   - ✅ Format: ID | Section | Item | Content estimated in template outline | presale's Answer |
   - ✅ Left blank for presale to fill

### Content Generation Rules

1. **Always extract from Deal Transfer first** - Use Deal Transfer as primary source before making estimates
2. **Never leave sections completely empty** - Make best estimate and use placeholder
3. **Use standard module names** when available in `STANDARD_MODULES.md`
4. **Include Image URL and Video URL for standard modules** - When a module is classified as Standard (found in `STANDARD_MODULES.md`), extract Image URL and Video URL from `STANDARD_MODULES.md` (if available). Custom modules do NOT include these URLs.
5. **Convert pain points/VA use cases to AI modules** - Map each use case to specific module
6. **Calculate timeline realistically** 
7. **Be specific** - Avoid vague statements, use concrete numbers and details
8. **Maintain consistency** - Camera numbers, module counts should be consistent across sections
9. **Document everything in reasoning file** - Even obvious mappings should be documented for traceability

## Example Placeholder IDs

Use descriptive prefixes:
- `NETWORK_001`, `NETWORK_002` - Network requirements
- `TIMELINE_001`, `TIMELINE_002` - Timeline questions
- `ARCH_001` - Architecture clarifications
- `MODULE_001` - Module-specific questions
- `DASHBOARD_001` - Dashboard requirements
- `INTEGRATION_001` - Integration questions

## Next Steps After Generation

After generating the three files:
1. **Presale Review**: Send `[Project_Name]_checklist.md` to presale team for confirmation
2. **Update Template**: After presale fills checklist, use `proposal-checklist-update` skill to update template
3. **Proceed**: Once template has no placeholders, proceed to next workflow step (e.g., slide-content-mapper)
